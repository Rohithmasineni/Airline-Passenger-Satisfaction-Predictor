## Airline Passenger Satisfaction Predictor – Deep Learning Web App ✈️ 

An end-to-end machine learning & deep learning solution designed to predict airline passenger satisfaction using flight experience data. This project brings together **PyTorch**, best practices in data science, and a clean **Streamlit UI** for real-time interaction, deployed seamlessly on **Hugging Face Spaces**.

---

## 📌 1. Project Description and Goals

### 🔍 Overview  
This project focuses on predicting a passenger's satisfaction status (**Satisfied** or **Neutral/Dissatisfied**) based on various flight experience factors such as inflight service, class, delay status, and more.

### 🎯 Goals
- **Prediction** – Accurately predict passenger satisfaction using a deep learning model.  
- **Insights** – Identify factors contributing to dissatisfaction, helping airlines enhance customer experience.
